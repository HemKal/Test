Design a parking lot system 
1. Before you start inspect the UNIT Tests to get idea of what you will be designing and how objects are designed
2. While implementing explain your thought process before coding
3. You have two ways to start either bottom up (vehicle to garage) or top down (garage to vehicle)
4. Now for problem. It will handle two types of vehicle spaces (COMPACT and FULL)
5. Garage should be of fixed size for two types.
6. Initialze Parking system accordingly and when parking is taken by vehicle issue a ticket
7. Identify type of vehicle parked and how many spaces is remaining for two types of Vehicles
8. There is Garage Driver class which can be run to test while implementing the solution
9. When the solution is complete run given JUNIT tests to pass
